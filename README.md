# Market Link Extension

This project aims to solve the problem of adding a link to the Steam Marketplace from the Market.csgo website. The Steam Marketplace is a platform where users can buy, sell, and trade in-game items for various games, including Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO).

## Problem Description

The Market.csgo website provides a convenient way for CS:GO players to browse and trade in-game items. However, it lacks a direct link to the Steam Marketplace for each item. This makes it challenging for users to quickly access the Steam Marketplace to view additional item details, pricing information, and make purchases.

## Solution

The Market Link Extension project provides a solution to this problem by automating the process of generating a link to the Steam Marketplace from the Market.csgo website. It utilizes web scraping techniques to extract the necessary item information and constructs a URL that redirects the user directly to the corresponding item's page on the Steam Marketplace.

## Features

- **Market Link Extension**: The project automatically generates a link to the Steam Marketplace for each item listed on Market.csgo.
- **Easy Integration**: The solution can be easily integrated into the Market.csgo website or any other CS:GO trading platform.
- **User-friendly Interface**: The generated link is presented to the user in a user-friendly format, allowing for easy access to the Steam Marketplace.
