# Market Link Extension

**Market Link Extension** automatically adds direct links to the Steam Marketplace for every item listed on the [Market.csgo](https://market.csgo) website.

## Problem Description

Market.csgo is a popular platform for browsing and trading CS:GO items. However, it lacks direct links to the corresponding item pages on the Steam Marketplace. This forces users to manually search for items on Steam, which is inconvenient and time-consuming.

## Solution

This extension solves the problem by automatically extracting item data from Market.csgo using web scraping techniques and generating direct links to the relevant Steam Marketplace pages. The links are displayed prominently and conveniently, allowing users to quickly access detailed item information or make purchases on Steam.
